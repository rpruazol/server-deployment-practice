## Node

- Javascript runtime

  - tool to make applications more dynamic faster
  - you can make servers!
  - async i/o
  - javascript sans browser

- Professional development patterns and habits

  - modular code!
    - reusable blocks of code for plug and play
      - modules are important for code readability, reuse, scalability
  - we will also be adding in testing to our projects in a more formal way

- What is a server

  - a host: somewhere information could be stored
  - a middleman!

  - Your laptop is also a server (physically) just like those
  - Software can also be a server
  - Functions are also servers
  - **Anything that can accept a request and serve back an answer is a server**
  - In an app, you have clients and servers at every logical point in code
  - So ... no, Node.js is not a server, it's a tool you can use to make a server
